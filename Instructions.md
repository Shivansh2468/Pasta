Preparation Time - 7 minutes

Cooking Time - 15 minutes

#### Directions:-

1) Boil raw pasta according to the instructions on the package or follow the instructions given:- Take 4-5 cups of water in a deep sauce pan, bring it to boil over medium flame. When it starts boiling add 3/4 cups of Penne pasta or any other pasta and 1/2 teaspoons of salt and oil.

2) Boil them until cooked (but not very soft). It will take about 10 to 12 minutes. To check it the pasta is cooked take one in a fork and bite it. If its too hard to bite or it is chewy then it requires more cooking. 

3) Transfer cooked pasta into a large colander and drain water.

4) While water is draining off the pasta, heat 1/2 teaspoons of oil in a pan over high flame. Add the chopped vegetables and salt.

5) Stir and cook until veggies are cooked but still crunchy, for around 2-3 minutes. Turn off the flame and transfer them onto a plate. 

6) Heat 1 and a half tablespoons of butter in the same pan over medium flame. Add 1/2 teaspoons of finely chopped garlic and saute for about 30 seconds.

7) Add 1 and a half tablespoons of all purpose flour(maida), stir continuously and cook for a minute.

8) Pour 1 and a half cups of milk while stirring continuously with a whisk.

9) Stir and mix for 1-2 minutes.

10) Reduce flame to low. Continue stirring and cooking until mixture starts to thicken. It will take around 3-4 minutes depending on the size and thickness of the pan. When mixture starts to coat the back of the spoon  it means that it has started to thicken. 

11) Add 1/4 teaspoon oregano, 1/4 teaspoons of red chilli flakes, a pinch of black pepper powder and salt.

12) Add sauted vegetables and pasta.

13) Turn off the flame and mix well.

14) Transfer the pasta onto a serving plate. White sauce pasta is now ready. Garnish with grated cheese and serve while still hot!!!
